## Weekly bike traffic in Seattle
This week's #TidyTuesday dataset is bike traffic in Seattle. Interestingly, 
this isn't geographic data-though we could add that by finding the coordinates
of the counting stations-so instead I thought it might be interesting to
capture the seasonality of bike traffic at different counting stations. 

Start by loading the required packages and downloading the data from GitHub. 

```{r load packages message=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
library(RColorBrewer)
```

```{r load data message=FALSE}
player_dob <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-04-09/player_dob.csv")

grand_slams <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-04-09/grand_slams.csv")

grand_slam_timeline <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-04-09/grand_slam_timeline.csv")
```


```{r}
grand_slams_reduced <- grand_slams %>% 
  select(year, grand_slam, name, gender) %>%
  group_by(year, gender, grand_slam)  
```

```{r}
player_dob_reduced <- player_dob %>%
  select(name, grand_slam, date_of_birth) 
```

```{r}
player_dob$name %in% grand_slams$name
```

```{r}
age_slams_comb <- left_join(grand_slams_reduced,
                            player_dob_reduced,
                            by = c("name", "grand_slam"))
```



```{r}

```
